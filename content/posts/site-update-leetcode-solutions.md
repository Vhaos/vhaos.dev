Introducing {{<fancylink href="vhaos-leetcode-solutions.now.sh/leetcodedaily" label="Vhaos's LeetCode Solutions ðŸš€">}}! A '_sister site_' to **VHAOS.DEV**. Iâ€™ve created it to serve as a more visual archive of my solutions to various {{<fancylink href=" leetcode.com/" label="LeetCode">}} coding problems. It also doubles as a nifty way of keeping track of the problems I've solved thus far. 

The site (much like **VHAOS.DEV**) is built using {{<fancylink href="gohugo.io" label="Hugo">}} and hosted on {{<fancylink href="www.vercel.com" label="Vercel">}}. The theme is based of a port of the fantastic {{<fancylink href="hexo.io/" label="Hexo">}} theme, {{<fancylink href="github.com/probberechts/hexo-theme-cactus/" label="Cactus ðŸŒµ">}} by Pieter Robberechts.

Most solutions there are written primarily in _JavaScript_, however a small number also feature code in _Java_ and _Python_. You can find the full list {{<fancylink href="vhaos-leetcode-solutions.now.sh/leetcodedaily" label="here">}}.

I plan to semi-regularly post my LeetCode solutions there, as well occasionally reference it on algorithm related posts on **VHAOS.DEV**. If you'd like to suggest any improvements to the site or request solutions to specific LeetCode questions, feel free to reach out using my links in the site footer!
