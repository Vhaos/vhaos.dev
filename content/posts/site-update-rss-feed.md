> **Edit:** the recently updated [JSON Feed 1.1](https://jsonfeed.org/version/1.1) spec brings the more specific `application/feed+json` MIME type; I've updated the site's JSON Feed has to use this MIME type for JSON Feeds instead.

Another new site update ðŸŽ‰ (albeit a small one). In this update I've added support for both {{<fancylink href="validator.w3.org/feed/docs/rss2.html" label="RSS">}} and {{<fancylink href="jsonfeed.org/" label="JSON Feeds">}}. Now anyone can subscribe to get the latest updates using their feed reader of choice ðŸ“².

Admittedly, implementing this took slightly longer than I had anticipated, specifically when it came to generating my own templates. While Hugo has a decent amount of {{<fancylink href="gohugo.io/templates/rss/" label="documentation">}} on this, figuring out how it all fit together eluded me. Looking back, it does make _a lot_ more sense now, but to quote the words of another programmer:

>_"it makes a ton of sense after you already know whatâ€™s going on â€” but not before."_

I might consider writing a post on how to add RSS and JSON feeds to a Hugo site in the future. Until then, please feel welcome to check back in again for more updates.
