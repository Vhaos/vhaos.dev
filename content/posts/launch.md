Welcome to **VHAOS.DEV** 🙋, The personal coding blog of {{<fancylink href="http://twitter.com/kareemdagg" label="Kareem">}} ! This site will feature various articles relating to software engineering and computer science. Topics will include interesting Algorithms, Data Structures, JavaScript, Docker, Kubernetes, Linux and more. Articles on other unrelated, topics may appear from time to time. **_I'm also open to suggestions on topics to you might like me to talk about and explore._** 📩

I've created this site to help share and document the information and knowledge I’ve gathered from working in tech over the years with the hopes that other people might benefit (or at the very least find intriguing). The site is targeted at enthusiasts, hobbyists, young professionals as well as computing students to some degree.

I intend to slowly add various interesting features and upgrades to the site itself over time; although, the general retro terminal look and feel will likely remain mostly the same. It's an aesthetic I very much enjoy.  

Bear in mind, articles on this site may also change over time. I will however try to document any substantial edits as well as any major corrections in the post footers.

Feel more than welcome to browse around and stand by for launch of the first articles later this week! 👩‍🚀
