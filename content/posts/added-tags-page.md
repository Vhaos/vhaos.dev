A {{<fancylink href="/tags" label="TAGS">}} section has been added to the site. It lists all the topics that have been discussed in tutorials and articles grouped together by hashtags. My aim is to provide an easy way for visitors find posts on the themes they care about (at least until some search functionaility is implemented) 

Stay tuned for more features in the coming weeks. A few ideas I've received so far:

- [ ] search
- [ ] an RSS feed
- [ ] site analytics
- [ ] a theme picker
- [ ] comments section

If you any suggestions for improving the site, reach out on {{<fancylink href="twitter.com/kareemdagg" label="Twitter">}} or {{<fancylink href="mailto:kareemdaggash@gmail.com" label="email">}}!
