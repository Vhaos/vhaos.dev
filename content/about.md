# Hi there

My name is Kareem and this is a site where I write about compters, primarily posts sharing computer science concepts, tutorials, as well as various other development tips I stumble across.

The site is built with {{<fancylink href="www.google.com" label="Hugo">}}, a static site generator. The theme is based on {{<fancylink href="www.google.com" label="Terminal">}} by panr. The site is running on {{<fancylink href="www.google.com" label="Vercel">}}. The domain is registered on {{<fancylink href="godaddy.com" label="Godaddy">}}. This site is developed and written on a Manjaro Linux system.
